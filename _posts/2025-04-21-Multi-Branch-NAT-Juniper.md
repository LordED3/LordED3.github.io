# Multi-Branch Enterprise Network Design with Juniper

## Overview

This project builds a simulated multi-branch enterprise network using Juniper vSRX routers and firewalls. A central HQ connects to two remote branches (Branch A and Branch B) via point-to-point links, with the HQ providing centralized internet access through NAT. Dynamic routing is achieved using OSPF to ensure seamless communication across all sites.
The lab focuses on key enterprise networking concepts, including dynamic routing, NAT/PAT and inter-VLAN routing.

## Project Objectives

- Configure OSPF Area 0 across all routers  
- Implement inter-VLAN routing at each branch  
- Establish security zones at HQ to separate internal and external networks  
- Set up NAT at HQ for internet access  
- Ensure full connectivity between branches and the internet

_Network Topology_

## Network Components

- **HQ Router/Firewall**: Juniper vSRX (flow-based mode)  
- **Branch A Router**: Juniper vSRX (packet-based mode)  
- **Branch B Router**: Juniper vSRX (packet-based mode)  
- **L2 Switches**: For VLAN segmentation at each branch  
- **ISP node**: Provides internet connectivity

## Testing and Validation
The following tests were performed to validate the configuration. The demo video below showcases these tests.

- **OSPF Neighbors**: Verification of OSPF neighbor relationships using `show ospf neighbor`.  
- **Inter-VLAN Communication**: Connectivity test between VLANs within each branch.  
- **Inter-Branch Communication**: Connectivity test between devices in different branches.  
- **Internet Access**: Successfull pings to an external IP (e.g., ping 1.1.1.1) from branch devices via NAT.  

## ðŸŽ¥ Demo Video

The video below showcases:

- NAT functionality 
- Successful Inter-VLAN and Inter-branch routing.
- OSPF neighbor establishment and route learning

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates essential enterprise networking practices using Juniper vSRX devices. The successful deployment of OSPF, NAT, and VLANs ensures robust connectivity across branches and lays the groundwork for exploring more advanced topics like BGP, stricter firewall policies, and DMZ deployment.
