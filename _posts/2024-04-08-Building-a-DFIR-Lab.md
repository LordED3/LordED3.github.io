## Objectives

1. **Build FlareVM**

   - Create a dedicated Windows 10 VM in VMware Workstation.
   - Prepare the VM to meet the prerequisites to install Flare VM.
   - Download FlareVM from the official GitHub repository.

   **Aim:** Establish a specialized Windows environment optimized for malware analysis and reverse engineering.

2. **Download and Setup REMnux VM on VMware Workstation**

   **Aim:** Setup a Linux-based platform equipped with a comprehensive suite of malware analysis tools and utilities.

3. **Install Wazuh as an EDR, XDR, and SIEM Solution**

   - Set up a dedicated virtual machine for Wazuh using Ubuntu or CentOS.
   - Install and configure the Wazuh manager, agents, and Elasticsearch as per the official documentation.

   **Aim:** Establish a robust security monitoring system capable of endpoint detection and response (EDR), extended detection and response (XDR), and security information and event management (SIEM).


## Conclusion

Building a DFIR lab demonstrates my commitment to lifelong learning and professional development in cybersecurity. By creating a dedicated space for practical experimentation and exploration, I am laying the groundwork for my continuous growth and mastery in the field of digital forensics and incident response.
